### Game Rules

* Players alternate roles each round.
* Attacker always uses the last card(s) in hand.
* Defender does not act — only endures the attack.
* Once all defender cards are defeated, the goalkeeper becomes the final line of defense.
* Beating the goalkeeper scores a goal and switches roles.


### Attack Types
#### Single Attack:
* Uses the last card in the attacker’s hand.

#### Double Attack:
* Uses the last two cards in the attacker’s hand.

### Attack Outcomes

#### Success:

* Beaten defender(s) are added to the end of the attacker's hand.

* Attacker continues attacking.

#### Failure:

* Roles switch — the defender becomes the new attacker.

#### Tie:

* The next-to-last cards are compared.

* The stronger combination wins the round.

### Boosting
* The attacker can boost their own defender cards or goalkeeper.

* Boosting increases card strength, based on the boosting card's value:

* Two += 6
* Three += 5
* Four += 5
* Five += 4
* Six += 4
* Seven += 3
* Eight += 3
* Nine += 2
* Ten += 2
* Jack += 1
* Queen += 1
* King += 1
* Ace += 0


* Boosting counts as one action per turn.
* If no actions remain, boosting is disabled and a warning is displayed.

### Swap Mechanics

#### Regular Swap
* Select a card from your hand.
* Swap it with the last card in your hand.

#### Reverse Swap
* Reverses the entire hand order instantly.

#### Notes on Actions
* Every swap (regular or reverse) consumes one action.
* Once the turn's actions are used up, no further actions can be performed.
