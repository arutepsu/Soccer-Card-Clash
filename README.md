# Soccer Card Clash
An unofficial Scala version of the Soccer Card Clash game for Software Engineering classes at HTWG Konstanz.

* Soccer Card Clash is a fast-paced, strategic 2-player card game where soccer meets tactical mind games.
* Outmaneuver your opponent with clever attacks, boosts, and hand manipulation to score goals and win the match.
---
### Game Overview
* Each player controls a hand of soccer-themed player cards.
* Take turns as the attacker or defender.
* Outsmart your opponent by choosing the right action at the right time.
* Score goals by breaking through all defenders and beating the goalkeeper.

## ðŸ§± Architecture
This game is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and modularity.

### ðŸ”¹Model

The model contains the immutable core logic of the game:

* Cards, roles, scores, and game state
* Designed for predictability, testability, and safe concurrent use

### ðŸ”¹ View
Two synchronized views provide flexible interaction:

* Text-based UI (TUI) for quick testing and interaction via console
* Graphical UI (GUI) built with ScalaFX, offering a richer user experience

### ðŸ”¹ Controller
The controller mediates between the model and views:

* Processes commands and applies changes to the game state
* Supports undo/redo functionality
* Dispatches events independently to both TUI and GUI observers
